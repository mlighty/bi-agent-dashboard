# HubSpot Connection
# 
# HubSpot doesn't have a native Evidence connector, so we:
# 1. Sync data via API to local DuckDB/Postgres
# 2. Query that cached data from Evidence
#
# For actions (create/update contacts, deals, etc.), use the execution scripts directly.

name: hubspot
type: duckdb

options:
  filename: hubspot_cache.duckdb

# Environment variables needed:
# HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN (private app access token)
#
# To create a private app:
# 1. Go to HubSpot > Settings > Integrations > Private Apps
# 2. Create app with scopes you need (crm.objects.contacts.read, etc.)
# 3. Copy the access token

# Available data after sync:
# - contacts: All contacts with properties
# - companies: All companies with properties  
# - deals: All deals with properties
# - deal_stages: Pipeline stages
# - owners: HubSpot users/owners
